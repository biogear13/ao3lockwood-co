As she had scrambled away from them, she’d been faced with her friends, standing in a half-circle around her, their eyes dead. Their pale, blue-tinted faces lingered in her mind. She clutched the handrail, leaning heavily against it as she half-fell down the last three steps. Maybe she wasn’t doing enough. Maybe there was more she could do. Maybe, if she just tried harder, nobody else would have to die. She could save everyone.After taking in a few steadying breaths at the bottom of the stairs to calm her trembling body, Lucy pushed into the kitchen. She flicked on the lamp, and turned to the room to find Lockwood sitting with his feet in fuzzy slippers up on the table.“Hell,” Lucy swore, hand flying to her chest. “Are you trying to give me a heart attack?”Lockwood raised an eyebrow slowly. “Not particularly.
