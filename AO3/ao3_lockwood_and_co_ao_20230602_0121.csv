She clutched the handrail, leaning heavily against it as she half-fell down the last three steps. Maybe she wasn’t doing enough. Maybe there was more she could do. Maybe, if she just tried harder, nobody else would have to die. She could save everyone.After taking in a few steadying breaths at the bottom of the stairs to calm her trembling body, Lucy pushed into the kitchen.

The shape had solidified, more or less. It was of a girl. The girl looked no older than eleven, and she had blonde hair, which fell down her back in a shower of ringlets. Her thin, frail arms were wrapped around her scabbed knees, her feet bare. She seemed to be wearing a dress. The girl stood, her motions slow, like she was immersed in molasses. She drifted to the center of the room.Now I could see that she was wearing a dress, canary yellow, the hem adorned by embroidered flowers, with cap sleeves. She had a yellow ribbon tied in her hair like a headband. I could not see her face, as it was obscured by a solid wedge of darkness.
